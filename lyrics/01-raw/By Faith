By faith 
we see the hand of God
In the light 
of creation's grand design

In the lives of those 
who prove His faithfulness
Who walk by faith 
and not by sight

By faith 
our fathers roamed the earth
With the power of 
His promise in their hearts

Of a holy city 
built by God's own hand
A place where 
peace and justice reign

We will stand as 
children of the promise
We will fix our eyes 
on Him our soul's reward

Till the race is finished 
and the work is done
We'll walk by faith 
and not by sight

By faith 
the prophets saw a day
When the longed-for 
Messiah would appear

With the power to break 
the chains of sin and death
And rise triumphant 
from the grave

By faith 
the church was called to go
In the power of 
the Spirit to the lost

To deliver captives 
and to preach good news
In every corner 
of the earth

We will stand as 
children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on 
Him our soul’s reward

Till the race is finished 
and the work is done
We’ll walk by faith 
and not by sight

By faith 
this mountain shall be moved
And the power of the 
Gospel shall prevail

For we know in Christ 
all things are possible
For all who 
call upon His name

We will stand as 
children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on 
Him our soul’s reward

Till the race is finished 
and the work is done
We’ll walk by faith 
and not by sight

Oh, we will stand as 
children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on 
Him our soul’s reward

Till the race is finished 
and the work is done
We’ll walk by faith 
and not by sight

We’ll walk by faith 
and not by sight
