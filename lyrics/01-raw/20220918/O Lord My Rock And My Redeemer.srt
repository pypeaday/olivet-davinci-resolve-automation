O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer
Greatest treasure of my longing soul
My God, like You there is no other
True delight is found in You alone

Your grace, a well too deep to fathom
Your love exceeds the heaven's reach
Your truth, a fount of perfect wisdom
My highest good and my unending need

O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer
Strong defender of my weary heart
My sword to fight the cruel deceiver
And my shield against his hateful darts

My song, when enemies surround me
My hope, when tides of sorrow rise
My joy, when trials are abounding
Your faithfulness, my refuge in the night

O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer
Gracious Savior of my ruined life
My guilt and cross laid on Your shoulders
In my place You suffered bled and died

You rose, the grave and death are conquered
You broke my bonds of sin and shame
You rose, the grave and death are conquered
You broke my bonds of sin and shame

O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer
May all my days 
bring glory to Your Name

May all my days 
bring glory to Your Name
