Turn your eyes 
upon Jesus
Look full in 
His wonderful face

And the things of earth 
will grow strangely dim
In the light of 
His glory and grace

Turn your eyes 
to the hillside
Where justice and 
mercy embraced

There the Son of God 
gave His life for us
And our measureless 
debt was erased

Jesus, to You
we lift our eyes
Jesus, our glory 
and our prize

We adore You, behold You
our Savior ever true
Oh Jesus, we turn our eyes 
to You

Turn your eyes 
to the morning
And see Christ 
the Lion awake

What a glorious dawn
fear of death is gone
For we carry 
His life in our veins

Jesus, to You
we lift our eyes
Jesus, our glory 
and our prize

We adore You, behold You
our Savior ever true
Oh Jesus, we turn our eyes 
to You

Turn your eyes 
to the heavens
Our King will 
return for His own

Every knee will bow 
every tongue will shout
'All glory to Jesus alone!'

Jesus, to You
we lift our eyes
Jesus, our glory 
and our prize

We adore You, behold You
our Savior ever true
Oh Jesus, we turn our eyes 
to You

Jesus, to You
we lift our eyes
Jesus, our glory 
and our prize

We adore You, behold You
our Savior ever true
Oh Jesus, we turn our eyes 
to You
