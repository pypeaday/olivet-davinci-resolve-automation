        [Verse 1]
We won't fear the battle
we won’t fear the night
We will walk the valley 
with You by our side

You will go before us
You will lead the way
We have found a refuge
only You can save

[Chorus]
Sing with joy now
our God is for us
The Father's love 
is a strong and mighty fortress

Raise your voice now
no love is greater
Who can stand against us
if our God is for us

[Verse 2]
Even when I stumble
even when I fall
Even when I turn back
still Your love is sure

You will not abandon
You will not forsake
You will cheer me onward
with never-ending grace

[Chorus]
Sing with joy now
our God is for us
The Father's love
is a strong and mighty fortress

Raise your voice now
no love is greater
Who can stand against us
if our God is for us

[Bridge]
Neither height nor depth
can separate us
Hell and death
will not defeat us

He who gave
His son to free us
Holds me in His love

Neither height nor depth
can separate us
Hell and death
will not defeat us

He who gave
His son to free us
Holds me in His love

[Chorus]
Sing with joy now
our God is for us
The Father's love
is a strong and mighty fortress

Raise your voice now
no love is greater
Who can stand against us
if our God is for us

Sing with joy now
our God is for us
The Father's love
is a strong and mighty fortress

Raise your voice now
no love is greater
Who can stand against us
if our God is for us
