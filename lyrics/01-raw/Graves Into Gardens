I searched the world
But it couldn't fill me
Man's empty praise 
And treasures that fade
Are never enough

Then You came along
And put me back together
And every desire is now satisfied
Here in Your love

Oh, there's nothing 
Better than You
There's nothing 
Better than You

Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You, no

I'm not afraid
To show You my weakness
My failures and flaws
Lord, You've seen them all
And You still call me friend

'Cause the God of the mountain
Is the God of the valley
And there's not a place 
Your mercy and grace
Won't find me again

Oh, there's nothing 
Better than You
Oh, there's nothing 
Better than You

Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You

Oh, there's nothing 
Better than You
Oh, there's nothing 
Better than You

Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You

You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory
You're the only one who can

You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory
You're the only one who can

You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways

You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can

Oh, there's nothing 
Better than You
Lord, there's nothing 
Better than You

Oh, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You
There's nothing
Oh, there's nothing better than You

There's nothing 
Better than You
There's nothing
Nothing is better than You

You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways

You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can
